# Setup

- Create database with name `db_catalog` and import `db_catalog.sql`
- To run this project, you must be place this project under `$GOROOT` path, for example, my `$GOROOT` is inside `/Users/lumbung/Documents/Go`, so this project must be located in `/Users/lumbung/Documents/Go/src/github.com/gedelumbung/go-catalog`
- Adjust database config with your own local environment and run `go run main.go` from root application directory
